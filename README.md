#  Expensify-App

This project is a dynamic React.js application. It is built using **React.js**, **Redux Store** and **Firebase Database**. The idea behind this project is to allow the user to keep a check on his/her expenses. User can **add**, **edit** and **remove** his expenses. These expenses are stored in Firebase Database. To access the expenses the user first has to login with **firebase google authentication**. User can also apply filters on the expenses list such as **filter by time**, **name**, **date** or **amount**. Redux Store is used to configure the state which can be shared amongst all the components. **Sass** is used for styling the application. **Webpack and Babel** are some modules used for automation.
